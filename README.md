## Description

The **Ecommerce API** is a backend project built to support an e-commerce platform. It provides a robust and scalable API for managing products, orders, user authentication, and payments. The goal of this project is to facilitate seamless interactions between the front-end user interface and the underlying database.

This API enables users to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete secure checkout transactions. It incorporates various features such as user authentication using JWT, product search and filtering, and integration with the Stripe payment gateway for processing payments.

The Ecommerce API leverages the power of Node.js and Express.js to handle HTTP requests, while MongoDB serves as the database for storing and retrieving data. The integration with Stripe enables seamless payment processing, ensuring a secure and efficient checkout experience for customers.

With its extensible architecture and well-documented endpoints, the Ecommerce API provides a solid foundation for building e-commerce applications of varying sizes and complexities. It is designed to be easily customizable and scalable, allowing developers to add additional features and extend its functionality to meet specific project requirements.

Whether you're building a small online store or a large-scale e-commerce platform, the Ecommerce API is a reliable and efficient solution that simplifies backend development and accelerates time to market.
